## Lesson 10: How to Solve Problems

We look at how to solve a variety of problems and how we can follow a set of guidelines to break down large complex problems into smaller and more simple problems.

### Understanding a Problem
* The first step to understanding a problem is to look at the **inputs** and **outputs**
* There are inputs and outputs for every problem
* A solution to a problem is one that takes an input, implements a **procedure**, and produces an output

### What Are The Inputs?
* We figure out what the inputs are by first reading the question to find any given inputs, if no inputs are clearly stated we will have to think about what inputs the procedure requires to produce the output
* Not only is it important to determine what the inputs are, it is also import to determine how inputs are represented

### Obey the Rules
So far the steps for solving a problem are as follows:
  * Don't panic
  * What are the inputs?
  * What are the outputs?
  
Once we have followed the steps above, the final step is to solve the problem.

### Conclusion
We can finalize our steps on how to problem solve as follows:
  * Don't panic
  * What are the inputs?
  * What are the outputs?
  * Work through some examples by hand
  * Simple mechanical solution
  * Develop incrementally and test as we go
