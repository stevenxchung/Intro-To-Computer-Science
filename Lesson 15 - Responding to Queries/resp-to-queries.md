## Lesson 15: Responding to Queries

So far we have built a web crawler. However, the web crawler that was previously built does not respond to web queries. This unit, we will look at how we can pass in a keyword and get a list of pages that contain that keyword.

In order to respond to queries quickly we want to use a data structure which will enable us to look up a keyword and quickly find the pages that match the keyword (inverted index data structure).

### Networks

* A network is a group of entities that can communicate even though they are not all directly connected
* Networks have been around for over 3000 years (e.g. Greeks trying to communicate over long distances through smoke signals)
