## Lesson 15: Responding to Queries

So far we have built a web crawler. However, the web crawler that was previously built does not respond to web queries. This unit, we will look at how we can pass in a keyword and get a list of pages that contain that keyword.

In order to respond to queries quickly we want to use a data structure which will enable us to look up a keyword and quickly find the pages that match the keyword (inverted index data structure).

### Networks
* A network is a group of entities that can communicate even though they are not all directly connected
* Networks have been around for over 3000 years (e.g. Greeks trying to communicate over long distances through smoke signals)

### Latency
* Latency is the time it takes for messages to get from source to destination

### Bandwidth
* The amount of information that can be transmitted per unit time

### Bit
* A bit is the smallest unit of information

### Traceroute
* By using traceroute, we can find out all the destinations where packets are sent to and how long it takes for the packets to get there

### Protocols
* A protocol is a particular way the client communicates with the server. To get the web brower to render information sent from the server, the client sends a request to the server through a protocol (HTTP) and the server responds to the request
